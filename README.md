## 1. Behavioral Cloning

We record the data using the project stored under '.\LabVIEW\DL method'. Open the project using LabVIEW 2014. One can see the front panel of the program. Before running the program. Remember to plug in the XBOX360 controller.

When you click the running button. It asks you to run the python program after clicking the OK button.

Figure 2. Request for data recording.

Then, run the python program as follows. The program is stored in '.\Programs\Python'.

Now, you can see the entire program running.

For this program. We already load the trained controller. When you accelerate the car, it will manuver automatically. Instead, you can disable the controller and record your own actions. We will add full explanation in the future. 

## 2. Performance Testing

Similarly, we test the performance of the proposed method using the project stored under '.\LabVIEW\Auto Test'. Open the project using LabVIEW 2014. One can see the front panel of the program. Before running the program. Remember to plug in the XBOX360 controller.

When running this program. No human intervention is required. The following figure shows the snap shot of the program.

## 3. Fake data generation

We generate fake date using the program stored under '.\Matlab'. Open the 'mod_2_of_training_data_gen.m' using Matlab. One can see all codes of the main program. Run the code we can see the following illustration.
