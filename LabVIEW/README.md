Note that the LabVIEW project used to record data is in the folder 'DL method'. The project used for test is in the folder 'Auto Test'.

For the perpose of protection. All vi in our projects are protected by password. One can use our program without any problem. But one cannot modify them.

Remember, to run 'DL method' correctly, one has to plug in a XBOX360 conntroller first. Or the program cannot run properly.

Use LabVIEW 2014 or above to run the code.
